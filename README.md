Not just another Text Adventure Game Engine.

It's started as my first project from Digital Games College, but I want to push it forward.
So now its a open source project, to anyone who want to have some fun making Text Adventure Games.

The main goal is to make it easy how to create an Text Adventure Game just writing a script and leaving the hard work to the engine.
